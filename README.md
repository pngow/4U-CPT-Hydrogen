In this game, users play as a cell in an environment where different types of cells are moving toward the player's cell. During the game session, the player is required to collect "good" cells while avoiding "bad" cells. The more "good" cells that are collected, the faster the cells will move. The game ends when the player collides with a "bad" cell.
